# QuickForms 前端專案

## 專案介紹
QuickForms 是一個基於 Angular 框架開發的現代化問卷系統前端應用。本應用提供了直觀的用戶界面，支持問卷的創建、編輯、發布和數據統計等功能。

## 技術架構
- **框架**: Angular 19.0.2
- **UI庫**: Angular Material
- **狀態管理**: RxJS
- **開發工具**: Angular CLI

## 開發環境需求
- Node.js 18.x 或以上
- npm 9.x 或以上
- Angular CLI 19.0.2

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
